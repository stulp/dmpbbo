/**
 * \page page_serialization Serialization
 
Serialization and deserialization of objects serves two purposes in this code: 

\li Reading parameter/experiment settings from a file. For instance, you could specify the MetaParameters of a FunctionApproximator in a file, read that file in your program, and train a FunctionApproximator with those MetaParameters. To try different MetaParameters settings you only have to change the input file, without having to recompile.
To be able to edit such parameter files, the files should be human readable. Ideally, it should be JSON, because it is very readable and compact.

\li Saving the results of an experiment. Saving such results to binary files would be more compact, but to ensure that the same format is used for both serialization and deserialization, we use a human-readable format here also.


I considered the following options.

\li Boost property tree: it makes a mess of arrays when saving to JSON

\li Google protobuf: I preferred to not have code generated for me

\li cereal: http://uscilab.github.io/cereal/, external library. Really the best option, but I tried to avoid users having to use non-standard libraries.

\li jsoncpp: Not ideal for serialization, more for read/write of JSON.

In summary, I could not find any libraries that were easy to install and could serialize to/from JSON. Therefore, I went for the second choice, which was XML. Because boost is a standard, and compiles on most platforms, I decided to use boost:: serialization. I consider this to be quite a compromise, because I find boost::serialization quite messy, it is not well documented, and it took me quite a while to get it working properly (especially the registering of derived classes, for which you have to use a wierd combination of macros in the exact right places)

Since I was writing to XML with boost::serialization anyway, many classes implement a toString() method that simply returns the XML code (without a header) that results from serialization. 
The RETURN_STRING_FROM_BOOST_SERIALIZATION_XML macro does all the work for writing to an XML archive and converting it to a string. Having XML as output is not ideal, but it avoid lots of duplicate code. Perhaps boost::serialization will one day be able to write to JSON also, and then this could be used instead. 

I decided to go for string toString(void) instead of ostream& toStream(ostream&), because toString allows you to easily use both the output stream operator  (output << obj.toString()) and printf (printf("%s",obj.toString()), whereas toStream would be much more messy to use in combination with printf (not everyone likes to use the outputstream operator). 

\section sec_boost_serialization_ugliness Boost serialization issues

With boost::serialization, it is possible to serialize classes without a default constuctor with 
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_55_0/libs/serialization/doc/serialization.html#constructors
But load_construct_data requires the creation of an object, which we cannot when classes are abstract. It seems no-one knows how to solve this:
\li http://lists.boost.org/boost-users/2005/09/13827.php
\li http://boost.2283326.n4.nabble.com/serialization-Serializing-classes-with-no-default-constructors-td2557921.html

For this reason abstract base classes that are to be serialized with boost must have a default constructor, and may not have const members. This is really a pain, because a serialization library should not enforce such design decisions... But this is the way it is in the code.

\section sec_eigen_boost_serialization Serializing boost matrices

To avoid bloating the serialization of Eigen matrices with lots of XML tags, they are serialized in a special way. The following examples show how Eigen matrices are serialized in XML:

\li Standard matrix:
\code
<m>2X3; 0 0 0; 1 1 1</m>
\endcode

\li Vector:
\code
<m>3X1; 0 0 0</m>
<m>1X3; 0 0 0</m>
\endcode

\li Diagonal matrix (only the diagonal is saved, indicated with D instead of X:
\code
<m>3D3; 1 2 3</m>
\endcode
